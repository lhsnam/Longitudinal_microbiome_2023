## Acknowledgements
At the end of my Bachelor degree, I joined a Biology conference in Quy Nhon, Binh Dinh province. I met Dr Khanh, who introduced me to the greatest teacher - **Dr Hao Chung The** *(Post-doc Scientist, at Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam)*. Words can not express my gratitude to my master's thesis advisor. I started my Master Degree journey with a low-based knowledge in R language and Microbiome. During two years, he helped me kindly step by step, including the analysis, writing, and research skill. He was also the one who explore my data visualization skill - my most confident skill. 

Furthermore, I would not finished this thesis without the support of my colleagues in OUCRU-HCM, especially for Molecular Epidemiology group.
